# Overview

This is the third data analysis example I did from [MADA 2021](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/index.html). In this project, I cleaned some data from a [previously published paper](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.51c59zw4v) and made a few predictive models using the `tidymodels` framework.

# Pre-requisites

In order to recreate the analysis for this project, you will need
* R (technically 4.1.0 or later to enable the use of the base pipe `|>`);
* R Markdown (probably the latest version);
* Git (technically optional but much easier this way);
* A LaTeX distribution, such as TinyTeX which can be installed via R;
* Rtools 4, if you are on Windows; a stable version of `gcc` otherwise; and
* Any R packages used for data analysis.

# Project structure

* All data goes into the subfolders inside the `data` folder.
* All code goes into the `code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `products` subfolders.
* See the various `readme.md` files in those folders for some more information.
