This directory contains all finable deliverables for the project. Currently this includes a manuscript (stored in the `manuscript` subdirectory) showing the generated results, along with associated `csl` and `bib` files used to generate the manuscript.

In order to recreate the manuscript, you will need `R Markdown`, `bookdown`, and a LaTeX distribution.
